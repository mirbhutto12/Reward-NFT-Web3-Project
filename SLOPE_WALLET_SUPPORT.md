# Slope Wallet Support

## Current Status

The Slope wallet adapter (`SlopeWalletAdapter`) is no longer included in the `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` package. This is likely due to changes in the Solana wallet adapter ecosystem or the Slope wallet itself.

## Adding Slope Wallet Support

If you need to add Slope wallet support to your application, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Use a Custom Adapter

You can create a custom adapter for Slope wallet if you need to support it:

\`\`\`typescript
// This is a simplified example and may need adjustments
import { BaseWalletAdapter, WalletAdapterNetwork } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';

export class CustomSlopeWalletAdapter extends BaseWalletAdapter {
  // Implement the required methods and properties
  // ...
}
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Use a Separate Package

Check if Slope provides their own wallet adapter package that you can install separately.

### Option 3: Wait for Updates

The Solana wallet adapter ecosystem is actively maintained. Check for updates to the packages that might reintroduce Slope wallet support.

## Alternative Wallets

In the meantime, your application supports several other popular Solana wallets:

- Phantom
- Solflare
- Torus
- Ledger
- Sollet
- Clover
- MathWallet

These wallets provide good coverage for most users and should be sufficient for most applications.
