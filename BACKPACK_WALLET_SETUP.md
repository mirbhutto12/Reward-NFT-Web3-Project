# Adding Backpack Wallet Support

This guide explains how to add Backpack wallet support to your Solana application in a production environment.

## Installation

In your actual production project (not in the v0 preview environment), follow these steps:

1. Install the Backpack wallet adapter package:

\`\`\`bash
npm install @backpack-wallet/wallet-adapter
# or
yarn add @backpack-wallet/wallet-adapter
\`\`\`

2. Import the Backpack wallet adapter in your wallet provider:

\`\`\`typescript
import { BackpackWalletAdapter } from "@backpack-wallet/wallet-adapter"
\`\`\`

3. Add the Backpack wallet adapter to your list of wallet adapters:

\`\`\`typescript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
    new SolflareWalletAdapter({ network }),
    new BackpackWalletAdapter(), // Add Backpack wallet adapter
    // ... other wallet adapters
  ],
  [network]
)
\`\`\`

## Alternative Approaches

If you're unable to use the official Backpack wallet adapter, you can also:

1. Use the Backpack wallet's standard Solana wallet adapter if available
2. Implement a custom adapter using the Backpack wallet's API
3. Use a community-maintained adapter if available

## Testing

After adding Backpack wallet support, make sure to test:

1. Connection on desktop browsers
2. Connection on mobile devices
3. Transaction signing
4. Disconnection flow

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with Backpack wallet integration:

1. **Wallet Not Detected**: Make sure the user has the Backpack wallet installed
2. **Connection Failures**: Check network compatibility (mainnet vs devnet)
3. **Transaction Errors**: Verify transaction format and account permissions
